# Tartan-Tracks-New
#This is a multiplayer game loosely based off of Subway Surfers! Whereas in Subway Surfers, you are a single player being chased by the policeman, in this game, you are competing against another player.
#Jump up to dodge fences, switch lanes to dodge trains, and collect coins! You can speed up and slow down as well. You can also try to collide with other players to push them into incoming obstacles as well. 
#To play, import this repository into an editor, and make sure all files and subfolders are in one folder. Then, run main.py.
#CMU_graphics needs to be installed, but other than that, no other libraries are needed.
